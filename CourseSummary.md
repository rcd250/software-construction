# Software Construction   

Course is divided into two parts:  

1. Data Abstraction   
2. Object Oriented Programming   

## Data Abstraction  

### Overview   

- Implementation of programming principles (HowToCode course)   
- Large systems/ code bases   
- Object Oriented approach   
- Java programming language    

#### Instructors   

##### Dr Gail   

Role : Course creator, talks about topic structure, history and industrial context    
Research area: Argument human intelligenge to build complex systems   
Founder: Tasktop technologies / software delivery   

##### Dr Elisa

Role: Primary instructor   
Reaserch area: How developers relate to design   

#### Origins of software construction    

The course is created as an introductory course that equips students with systematic building blocks in design and code that span their careers irrespective
of programming languages and size of programs/systems.    

Traditional beginner courses focus on learning to great depth a programming language but never teach a student how to use that programming language to build 
programs.    

In software construction, focus is put on:    
- Foundations of computational structures like loops and conditionals    
- Exposure to large code bases    
- How to read unfamiliar code   
- How to build apps and programs that use alot of libraries and frameworks    

> This course helps you overcome intimidation when faced with large and complex code bases.    

#### Why Java?

#### Why OOP?
