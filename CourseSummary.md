# Software Construction   

Course is divided into two parts:  

1. Data Abstraction   
2. Object Oriented Programming   

## Data Abstraction  

### Overview   

- Implementation of programming principles (HowToCode course)   
- Large systems/ code bases   
- Object Oriented approach   
- Java programming language    

#### Instructors   

##### Dr Gail   

Role : Course creator, talks about topic structure, history and industrial context    
Research area: Argument human intelligenge to build complex systems   
Founder: Tasktop technologies / software delivery   

##### Dr Elisa

Role: Primary instructor   
Reaserch area: How developers relate to design   

#### Origins of software construction    

The course is created as an introductory course that equips students with systematic building blocks in design and code that span their careers irrespective
of programming languages and size of programs/systems.    

Traditional beginner courses focus on learning to great depth a programming language but never teach a student how to use that programming language to build 
programs.    

In software construction, focus is put on:    
- Foundations of computational structures like loops and conditionals    
- Exposure to large code bases    
- How to read unfamiliar code   
- How to build apps and programs that use alot of libraries and frameworks    

> This course helps you overcome intimidation when faced with large and complex code bases.    

#### Why Java?

#### Why OOP?    

#### Sylabus    

1. Introduction   
2. Control and Data flow: tructures
3. Control and Data flow: Models 
4. Data abstraction: Specifying and Using
5. Data abstraction: Testing and Implemantation
6. Types, Dispatch and Polymophism   
7. Final project  

#### Setup
- JDK

> Learn by Practicing   
> Be consistent    

#### Module activities

- Overview/ learning goals    
- Videos   
- Lecture qns   
- Long form coding problem   
- Quiz    
- Practice problems   
- Discussion topic    

### Introduction to Software Construction     

In this module we explore a java program without knowing any java syntax. This teaches us how to make sense of unfamiliar code since not all code we use 
is written by us and it also prepares us for circustances where you are in a new job and you are required to get upto speed with the company code.     

#### Key skills   

- Strategies to understand project structure
- Identify relationships between packages and classes

#### Things to learn   

- How to explore the behavior and structure of a system    
- Draw relationship diagrams between packages, between classes in a java system
- Make changes to the system to evaluate effect (breaking of some lines)     

#### Strategies to walk upto Unfamiliar code    

- Analyze files and folders   
- Run the program    
- Relate result to code   
- Identify package relationships and draw diagrams    
- Identify class relationships and draw diagrams
